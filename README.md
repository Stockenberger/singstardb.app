# SingStarDB.app

SingStarDB.app is a web application that allows users to search for songs and find out on which SingStar version they are available. 
It was created using [create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Help needed!
I have only added German PS2 SingStar songs for now. 
Feel free to open up a PR and add more songs to the [singstarData.json](https://github.com/Stockenberger/singstardb.app/blob/f09923a6b3e419cafc6475be6feefd84ac7b226a/src/singstarData.json).
